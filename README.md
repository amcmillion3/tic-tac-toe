# tic-tac-toe

This is the Tic-Tac-Toe Project from The Odin Project. It took me about 20 hours in total to do it. The purpose of the project was to get first hand experince using factory functions and the module pattern. Overall it is decent. I may come back in the future to add the computer.

Any helpful feedback is appreciated. Thanks for checking it out.
